A fun little flight simulator experiment I made.

It has realistic flight physics (modeled after the Su-25T from DCS)

run using `cargo run --release`

Supports any controller (tested with Xbox and Logitech 3D Extreme Pro)

Arrow keys (or axis 1) - Elevator / Ailerons\
Z / X - Rudder\
W / S - Throttle\
B - Airbrakes\
F - Flaps
